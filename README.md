# A Cold, Dark and very Gentle Place

ACDGP is a proof-of-concept game for a fully interactable game world made with godot 3.5 in C# (perhaps being updated to 4.0, once that reaches beta and thus C# functionality). The name derives from a quote from Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City.

Relax in a fully interactable cabin in the (fictionalized) Canadian North and enjoy the serenity of a sunny winter day and a clear night sky. Inspired by [The Long Dark](https://store.steampowered.com/app/305620/The_Long_Dark/) and Jacob Geller's video essay [The Intimacy of Everyday Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2MDVXPDNOM).
